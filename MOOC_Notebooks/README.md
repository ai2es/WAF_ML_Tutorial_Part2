This folder is a copy of the other notebooks you have already seen in this repo. The only difference is that these notebooks have been modified so they can be hosted in partnership with the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) hosted by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Feel free to use these notebooks here, but know they are mostly the same content as the other folders, just with a bit more notation on who wrote the notebooks and what paper they belong to.

Note there is no Notebook 1 because that just shows how to download the data to someone's personal machine and not colab.
