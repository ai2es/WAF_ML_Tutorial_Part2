We know there is no Notebook 1. Notebook 1 is how to grab the data and store it locally on your machine. On Google colab we need to grab this data everytime, thus at the start of every colab notebook you will need to download the data, which can take up to 20 mins. If it takes longer than 20 mins. Try another day or time, the server can be slow some days. 

Also note, the static examples for a few of the notebooks don't line up exactly with the jupyter versions. Need to set some seeds in future versions.
